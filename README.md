# karabiner-colemak
An easy Karabiner Elements implementation for Colemak, its mods, and extend. Easy Colemak for MacOS!

# What do I do?
Just go to the website https://profxwing.github.io/karabiner-colemak/ and everything should be taken care of.

Okay, a bit more in depth:
First, install [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
Then, on the website, choose which mods (or lack of mods) you would like to add, as well as the extend layer. 
Next, press Install.

This should pop up with an install question, which you should confirm. 

Now, in Karabiner Elements, just enable the layout (and extend if selected).

To enable/disable the layout, press LCMD + LSHIFT + grave (\`).

Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a Colemak layout.
